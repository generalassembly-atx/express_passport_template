We have built a social media app using a Node.js runtime environment and MongoDB as our database. We used Express.js as our framework in making this application as well.

We wanted the app to allow a user to sign up with user details and log in to their page that would show their account. We also wanted users to have a link to see a list of all of the users of the app and be able to friend another user and leave them a comment.

Installation instructions:

    -the phone number and age must be a number, no other characters.

Navigate to the other users page to view other users, or go back to your profile and edit your profile information
