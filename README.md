We have built a social media app using a Node.js runtime environment and MongoDB as our database. We used Express.js as our framework in making this application.

We wanted the app to allow a user to sign up with user details and log in to their page that would show their account. We also wanted users to have a link to see a list of all of the users of the app and be able to friend another user and leave them a comment.

Installation instructions:

Visit http://datehub.herokuapp.com/ to go to the page

Sign up as a new user and then login to your user with your email address and password
    -the phone number and age must be a number.

When you login, you are sent to your profile where you can see your profile details and a list of your friendships. You also have the option of editing any of your information on the page with the Edit button.

If you have no friends, go to the All Users page and click on a profile and Match with them to add them to your friendships list by clicking the match button.


Unsolved problems:

-Delete button for friendships - had route and button set up. Was able to get console to show that it was registering the delete, but ran short on time for figuring out what FindOneAndRemove should actually remove.

-If someone matches with you, it shows that you are matched with yourself on your profile page.
